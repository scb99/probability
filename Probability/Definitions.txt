Support:

Since we assume the number of possible outcomes of a discrete distribution is small, 
we can enumerate them; 
the set of possible outcomes is, oddly enough, 
called the support of the distribution.

Weight:

Some elements might be more likely than others; 
the ones that happen more often we say have more weight than the ones that 
happen less often. 
I want to be able to describe the weight of each member of a distribution easily, 
and I do not want to get off in the weeds of representing weights as doubles 
because double arithmetic has many pitfalls as we well know. 
For the purposes of this series I’m going to assume that we can weight the 
members of a distribution by an integer.

I’m going to require that the weight function accept any value of type T. 
If the value is not in the support, the weight is zero, and if the value is in 
the support, the weight is a positive integer. 
I’m going to further assume that the support and weights are small enough 
that the total weight fits into an integer.

If you divide the weight function by the total weight (as a double) then you have the 
probability mass function of the discrete distribution.
